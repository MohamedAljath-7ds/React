# Food Card Filtering

In this project i worked with the Usestate hook in react

where i build the feauture to filters out the top rating foods by using Usestate Hook

# Usestate Hook

usestate is a react hook that let you add the state variable

for eg const[variableName, setVariablename] = Usestate();
so here variableName is a variable and setVariablename is a function that is used to change the values.

# logic

 use filter method to filter out the top rating foods
 apply the filter method to the listOfFoods and create the function that will return only card with the high ratings  

# including search functionality

we want to change the state variable with input value so the input value is bind with state variable the state variable is empty
and after type something in search box it will update to the state variable by using the second parameter of the state variable(function) so for this in input field use onchange event handler to change the state variable by using state variable function the onchange event handler takes the event and when the occured the target returns the value to the state variable
