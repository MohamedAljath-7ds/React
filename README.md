# Food Card Filtering

In this project i worked with the Usestate hook in react

where i build the feauture to filters out the top rating foods by using Usestate Hook

# Usestate Hook

usestate is a state variable

for eg const[variableName, setVariablename] = Usestate();
so here variableName is a variable and setVariablename is a function that is used to change the values.

# logic
 use filter method to filter out the top rating foods
 apply the filter method to the listOfFoods and create the function that will return only card with the high ratings
